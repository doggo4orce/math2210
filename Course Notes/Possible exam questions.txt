final chapter:

1) [x] is non-zero in R[x]/(x^2+1), so must be a unit since x^2 + 1 is irreducible.  What is its multiplicative inverse?

2) 3 * 15 = 45 = 0 in Z5, why does this not imply that 3 is a zero divisor in Z5?

3) is every finite ring a field?

4) If x \in R[x] what can we say about R? (R is unital)

* f(x) in R[x], r in C REAL root of f(x), conjugate of r is also a root of f(x)
why doesnt this imply every polynomial has an even number of distinct complex roots?
