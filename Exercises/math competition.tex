\begin{enumerate}

\item[1.] For Adrienne not to know the birthday immediately, the number could not be any of $3, 20$ or $26$.  Since Nicole knew this, she must have been told that the month was either May or September.  Adrienne also arrives at this conclusion, and somehow determines the month.  This tells Nicole that the birthday must be September 1st, September 16th, or March 28th.  Since she still does not know the birthday, it must September 1st or 16th and the correct answer is (D).

%Since Nicole knows the number yet did not know the birthday, the number cannot be any of $3, 20$ or $26$.  Since Adrienne was able to infer the birthday just from hearing this information, she must have been told that the month was either March or November.  But Nicole now knows this too, so can narrow down the possibilities to either March 1st or November 18th.  And since she was told the number, she would now know which date is Harmony's birthday, which means this case is impossible.

\item[3.] The prime factorization of $3^{14} + 3^{13} - 12$ may be computed as
\begin{align*}
3^{14} + 3^{13} - 12 &= 3(3^{13} + 3^{12} - 4)\\
&=  3(3^{12}\cdot 4 - 4)\\
&=  3\cdot 4\cdot (3^{12}-1)\\
&=  2^2\cdot 3\cdot(3^{6} -1)(3^{6} + 1)\\
&=  2^2\cdot 3\cdot(3^3 - 1)(3^3 + 1)(3^{6} + 1)\\
&=  2^2\cdot 3\cdot 26\cdot 28\cdot (3^{6} + 1)\\
&=  2^5\cdot 3\cdot 7\cdot 13\cdot (3^{6} + 1)\\
&=  2^5\cdot 3\cdot 7\cdot 13\cdot 730\\
&=  2^6\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 13\cdot 73\\
\end{align*}

Hence $73$ is the largest prime divisor and the correct answer is (E).

\item[5.] Since $x + y + z = 1$, we must have also have $(x + y + z)^2 = 1$.  So
\begin{align*}
1 &= (x + y + z)^2\\
&= x^2 + xy + xz + yx + y^2 + yz + zx + zy + z^2\\
&= x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + zy + yz)\\
&= 3 + 2(xy + zy + yz).
\end{align*}
Therefore $xy + zy + yz = \frac{1-3}{2} = -1$ and the correct answer is (B).

\item[6.] Let $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ be the speeds of the faster and slower cyclist, respectively.  It is given that
\begin{center}
$s_{1} + s_{2} = k/t$ and $s_{1} - s_{2} = r/t$.
\end{center}
Adding and subtracting these equations yields
\begin{center}
$2s_{1} = \dfrac{k}{t} + \dfrac{r}{t}$ and $2s_{2} = \dfrac{k}{t} - \dfrac{r}{t}$.
\end{center}
Hence
\begin{center}
$\dfrac{s_{1}}{s_{2}} = \dfrac{2s_{1}}{2s_{2}} = \dfrac{\frac{k}{t} + \frac{r}{t}}{\frac{k}{t} - \frac{r}{t}} = \dfrac{r+t}{r-t}$,
\end{center}
making (A) the correct answer.

\item[9.] For $j=1,2$, let each of $R_{j}, G_{j}$ and $B_{j}$ respectively denote the events that a red, green, or ball is chosen for the first and second drawn card.  The probability that both cards are the same colour is given by
\begin{center}
$\dfrac{3}{9+k}\cdot\dfrac{2}{8 + k} + \dfrac{6}{9+k}\cdot\dfrac{5}{9+k} + \dfrac{k}{9+k}\cdot\dfrac{k-1}{8+k} = \dfrac{36 - k + k^2}{(9+k)(8+k)}$.
\end{center}
%
The probability that each card is a different colour is given by
\begin{center}
$\dfrac{3}{9+k}\cdot \dfrac{6+k}{8+k} + \dfrac{6}{9+k}\cdot \dfrac{3+k}{8+k} + \dfrac{k}{9+k}\cdot \dfrac{9}{8+k} = \dfrac{36 + 18k}{(9+k)(8+k)}$.
\end{center}
By assumption, these probabilities are equal, which means that $36 + 18k = 36 - k + k^2$, which is true when $k = 0$ or $k=19$.
\end{enumerate}
