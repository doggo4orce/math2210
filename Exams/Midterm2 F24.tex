\textbf{Notes:} 
\begin{itemize}

\item On the first page, you will be asked to complete five definitions.  Take your time, choose your words carefully, and say exactly what you mean.

\item One question is computational in nature.  Be sure to show your work clearly and logically.  Calculations that are chaotic or impossible to follow may not receive full credit, even if they are correct.

\item Fully justify your responses.  The final problem is of the form of a 'yes' or 'no' question.  It is to be understood that a proof will accompany your answer.

\item If you make a mistake, simply draw a line through your work to indicate that.  This way I can still read it if you change your mind!

\item Finally, don't get hung up on any one problem for too long -- you can always come back to it later!

\begin{questions}
\question[10] Complete each of the following definitions.  Abbreviations like $\exists$, $\forall$, or $\Rightarrow$ are fine, but statements are required to be complete and precise.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Let $R$ be a unital ring.  An element $a\in R$ is a \bf unit \md if
\vfill

\item Let $F$ be a field.  A polynomial $f(x)\in F[x]$ is \bf irreducible \md if 
\vfill

\item Let $R,S$ be rings.  A function $f:R\to S$ is a \bf homomorphism \md if
\vfill

\item An \bf integral domain \md is
\vfill

\item A \bf field \md is
\vfill

\end{enumerate}
\newpage


\question[5] What assumption must be placed upon a ring $R$ to guarantee that
\begin{center}
$(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2$
\end{center}
for every $a,b\in R$?
\newpage

\question[3] Let $R$ and $S$ be non-zero rings.  Prove that $R\times S$ is not an integral domain.
\newpage

\question[5] Let $R$ and $S$ be unital rings.  Prove that $(r,s)\in R\times S$ is a unit if and only if both $r$ and $s$ are units.
\newpage

\question[5] Show that $L = \SET{a\in\R:a > 0}$ is a ring under the operations $\oplus$ and $\odot$ defined by
\begin{center}
$r\oplus s = rs$ and $r\odot s = \ds{r^{\log(s)}}$.
\end{center}
\textbf{Bonus:} Prove $L$ is commutative!
\newpage


\question[3] Let $A = \SET{n\in\Z : n > 1}$ and define the relation $T$ on $A$ by
\begin{center}
$T = \SET{(a,b):\GCD{a,b} > 1}$.
\end{center}
Is $T$ an equivalence relation?
\vfill

\question[4] Solve the equation $16x = 14$ in $\Z_{26}$.
