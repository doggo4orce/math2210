\item \textbf{Unsupported answers may not receive full credit}.  A correct answer, unsupported by calculations, explanation,
or algebraic work may receive little or no credit; an incorrect answer supported by some correct calculations will likely receive partial credit.

\item \textbf{Organize your work}, in a reasonably neat and coherent way, in the space provided.  Work scattered all over the page without a clear ordering will receive very little credit.
