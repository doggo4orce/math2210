\textbf{Notes:} 
\begin{itemize}

\item On the first page, you will be asked to complete ten definitions.  Take your time, choose your words carefully, and be sure to say exactly what you mean.

\item Fully justify your responses.  Be sure to show your work clearly and logically.  Calculations that are chaotic or impossible to follow may not receive full credit, even if they are correct.

\item If you make a mistake, simply draw a line through your work to indicate that.  This way I can still read it if you change your mind!

\item Finally, don't get hung up on any one problem for too long -- you can always come back to it later!
