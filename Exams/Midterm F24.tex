\textbf{Reminders:} 
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Organize your work}, in a reasonably neat and coherent way, in the space provided. Work scattered all over the page without a clear ordering will 
receive very little credit.

\item \textbf{Clearly identify your final answer}, by circling it or enclosing it in a box.

\item \textbf{Unsupported answers may not receive full credit}.  A correct answer, unsupported by calculations, explanation,
or algebraic work may receive little or no credit; an incorrect answer supported by some correct calculations will likely receive partial credit.

\item \textbf{Phones should be turned off or in silent mode} -- and they should not be on your desk.  Put them away in a backpack or bag.  The same goes for smart watches.

\item \textbf{You may use a non-programmable scientific calculator.}  All you should have with you at your desk is a pencil (or pen), an eraser, and a calculator.  Beverages are fine, but nothing else should be nearby.  

\item \textbf{No scrap paper or formula sheets are allowed.}  If you need extra space, raise your hand and I will bring you extra paper.

\begin{questions}
\question[5] Complete each of the following definitions.  Abbreviations like $\exists$, $\forall$, or $\Rightarrow$ are fine, but statements should be complete and not fragmented.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Let $n\in\Z^{+}$ with $n > 1$.  A \bf zero-divisor \md in $\ZN$ is
\vspace{3cm}

\item Let $(S,*)$ be a binary algebraic structure.  $e\in S$ is an \bf identity element \md for $*$ if
\vspace{3cm}
\end{enumerate}
\newpage


\question[5] The set $S = \SET{0,1,2,3}$ is a binary algebraic structure under the multiplication operation $*$ defined by
\begin{center}
$a*b = \big(\text{max}(a,b) + 1\big)\% 4$.
\end{center}
\textbf{Reminders:} For any integers $a,b\in\Z$,
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\text{max}(a,b)$ denotes the maximum of $a$ and $b$, and
	\item $a\% b$ denotes the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Write out the multiplication table for $(S,*)$.
\vspace{8cm}

\item Prove that $(S,*)$ is not associative.

\end{enumerate}
