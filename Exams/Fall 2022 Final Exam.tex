\textbf{Reminders:} 
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Organize your work}, in a reasonably neat and coherent way, in the space provided. Work scattered all over the page without a clear ordering will receive very little credit.

\item \textbf{Clearly identify your final answer}, by circling it or enclosing it in a box.

\item \textbf{Unsupported answers may not receive full credit}.  A correct answer, unsupported by calculations, explanation,
or algebraic work may receive little or no credit; an incorrect answer supported by some correct calculations will likely receive partial credit.

\item \textbf{Phones should be turned off or in silent mode} -- and they should not be on your desk.  Put them away in a backpack or bag.  The same goes for smart watches.

\item \textbf{You may use a non-programmable scientific calculator.}  All you should have with you at your desk is a pencil (or pen), an eraser, and a calculator.  Beverages are fine, but nothing else should be nearby.  

\item \textbf{No scrap paper or formula sheets are allowed.}  If you need extra space, raise your hand and I will bring you extra paper.
