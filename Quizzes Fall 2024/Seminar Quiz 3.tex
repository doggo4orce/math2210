\question Let $\widehat{\Z}$ be the integers equipped with the operations $\oplus$ and $\odot$ defined by
\begin{center}
$a\oplus b = a + b - 1$ and $a\odot b = a + b - ab$
\end{center}
for all $a,b\in \widehat{\Z}$.  $\widehat{\Z}$ is a commutative unital ring.  \textbf{But you do not need to prove this!}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What are the additive and multiplicative identities $0_{\widehat{\Z}}$ and $1_{\widehat{\Z}}$?
\item Prove that $\widehat{\Z}$ is an integral domain.
\item Prove that $a\odot(b\oplus c) = (a\odot  b) \oplus (a\odot c)$ for any $a,b,c\in \widehat{\Z}$.
\end{enumerate}
