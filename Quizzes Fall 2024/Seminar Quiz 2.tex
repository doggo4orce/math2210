\question Let $n\in\Z^{+}$ with $n > 1$.  What is an \textbf{$n$th root of unity}?

\question Find and sketch all of the $6$th roots of unity in the complex plane below.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Expressing these roots of unity in polar form is perfectly fine.
\item Assume the hyphenated circle is the unit circle.
